Canvas → MediaStream → Video → Picture-in-Picture

first I need to create a canvas:
 <canvas>

then mediaStream:
 in js you use canvas.captureStream(fps) to get mediaStream (similar to input from webcams)


then video:
    have a <video></video> object so it tricks browswer into thinking there's a live stream
    video.srcObject = stream
    -> I tried to use src but src takes a link while srcObject takes a mediaStream
    had to look into URL.createObjectURL (since srcObject has limited support)

to get this screen
    video.requestPictureInPicture()


    I thought this would be <easy class=""></easy>'
    
    
maybe I need to revise my approach and make it
canvas -> images -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/how-to-generate-video-from-images-in-html5/'


the issue is that the animation is drawn before updating when it should be start capturing then the animations

Then picture in picture works however now I wont be able to update the pip without being on the screen


after struggling to figure it out I stumble upon
